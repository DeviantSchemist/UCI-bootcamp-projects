# PawPal

A web application that accesses the Petfinder API database so users can search their area for adoptable pets. Users can search, favorite, share, and chat with their future pets in a fun and easy way. It is the future of searching for a new furry or feathery family member. Users are able to create a profile and search through thousands of nearby adoptable pets and gain access to the contact information to take the next step in getting a new best friend.
